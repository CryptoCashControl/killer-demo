Gold prices surged during the North American session on Friday, rising 0.64% as the ongoing US government shutdown and weak economic data fueled safe‑haven demand. The precious metal’s value climbed to $4,002 after hitting a daily low of $3,974. US equity markets are on track for weekly losses, driven by risk aversion. As investors seek refuge, gold benefits from its traditional role as a hedge against uncertainty. In the forex market, traders are closely watching the XAU/USD pair, which has posted notable gains. With the shutdown showing no signs of resolution, gold’s appeal as a safe asset is likely to persist, influencing trading strategies in the forex arena. Current market dynamics are expected to keep gold prices supported in the near term.
