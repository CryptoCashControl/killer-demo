The USD/CAD currency pair pulled back on Friday, trading around 1.4064, down roughly 0.35% for the session. The move snapped a six‑day losing streak for the Canadian dollar as Canada’s labor market surprised to the upside, signaling unexpected resilience in the economy. The stronger‑than‑expected jobs report lifted the Loonie against the USD.  

Traders quickly re‑priced the pair, with short USD positions easing and CAD‑long bets gaining momentum. The exchange rate shift also nudged related pairs, such as EUR/USD, which saw modest upside as risk appetite improved. Market participants are now eyeing the 1.4100 resistance level and the 1.4000 support zone, while weighing the impact of upcoming US inflation data on the USD.  

If the CAD continues to ride the jobs‑data tailwinds, further gains against the USD are plausible, especially if US data disappoints. Conversely, a stronger US dollar could retest the 1.4000 floor, prompting short‑covering. Forex traders will monitor both Canadian employment releases and US macro reports closely, as the USD/CAD exchange rate remains a barometer for North‑American monetary divergence.
